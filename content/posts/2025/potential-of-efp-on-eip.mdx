# Potential of EFP on EIP

## **Exploring the Potential of EFP on EIP: Integrating Decentralized Influence Proof (DIP)**

**Abstract**  
In the Web3 ecosystem, influence is dispersed across different social networks and applications, lacking a unified measurement standard and cross-platform composability. Current influence measurement systems rely on centralized data sources, making them susceptible to manipulation and difficult to integrate across various Web3 applications. This paper explores the potential of **integrating EFP with Decentralized Influence Proof (DIP)** and how it can contribute to solving the problem of influence silos in Web3, providing a trusted influence measurement benchmark for social, DeFi, DAO, and NFT ecosystems under the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) framework.

## **Introduction**

As the Web3 ecosystem develops, influence has become a key factor in determining an individual's standing on the blockchain. Whether in decentralized social networks (e.g., Warpcast, Lens) or DAO governance, a user's influence directly impacts their value within the network. However, Web3 influence currently faces the following core issues:

1. **Cross-Platform Influence Silos**  
   - Existing Web3 social networks (e.g., Warpcast, Lens, Farcaster) and decentralized identities (e.g., ENS, DID) lack a universal influence measurement standard.
   - Users' influence on different platforms cannot be transferred, limiting the scalability of Web3 influence.

2. **Non-Verification**  
   - Current Web3 influence mainly relies on centralized APIs (e.g., The Graph, social media platform data interfaces), which make it difficult to ensure data authenticity and censorship resistance.
   - Influence algorithms are often controlled by a single platform, lacking transparency.

3. **Non-Composability**  
   - Web3 influence has yet to form a standard, causing DeFi, DAO, and NFT ecosystems to struggle with leveraging social influence as a basis for credit, governance, or recommendations.
   - Influence is not tied to assets, preventing it from being traded, rented, or staked like ENS domains.

4. **Lack of Real-World Identity Binding**  
   - Influence credentials are difficult to bind to real-world identities (e.g., KYC verification), limiting DIP's application in financial and governance scenarios with higher stakes.

Therefore, by integrating **DIP (Decentralized Influence Proof)** with **EFP**, we can create a **cross-platform, on-chain verifiable, composable influence standard** that is universally applicable across the Web3 ecosystem and enhance its applicability within the EIP framework.

## **The Potential of EFP Integrated with DIP**

### **Influence Mining Mechanism**

- **Concept**: Influence Mining is a part of the DIP ecosystem that allows users to earn token rewards by increasing their influence.
- **Mechanism**: The contribution value is calculated based on users' interactions on the social network (e.g., likes, shares, content creation), and DIP tokens are distributed accordingly.
- **Anti-Sybil Attack**: ZK proofs and social graph analysis are employed to prevent fake interactions and bot abuse.
- **Use Case**: Users can trade, vote, govern, or stake the mined DIP tokens to gain further benefits.

### **Application of EFP in the EIP System**

- **Standardizing Influence Measurement**: Submit the DIP influence calculation standard as an EIP, making it a universal protocol within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: By integrating EFP with DIP, it can serve as a standardized component for DAO governance and DeFi credit evaluation, improving fairness within the Web3 economy.
- **NFT and Influence Binding**: Influence calculated based on DIP can be used for NFT rankings, making the value assessment of NFT assets more transparent.

## **Future Prospects**

The integration of EFP with DIP and its inclusion in the EIP system will promote fairness and decentralization within the Web3 ecosystem, turning influence into a verifiable asset. In the future, further research could focus on:

1. **Influence Mining**: Reward users based on the growth of DIP influence, turning Web3 influence into a tradable asset.
2. **ZK Privacy Protection**: Ensure the privacy of influence data, allowing users to choose when to disclose their DIP data.
3. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Support multiple chains to facilitate broader influence interoperability.
4. **DIP Influence Market**: Allow users to trade, rent, or stake DIP influence, making influence a liquid asset and driving the decentralized influence economy.
5. **Multi-Dimensional Influence Scoring**: Introduce different dimensions of influence in the DIP calculation standard, such as community contribution, social interaction quality, and cross-platform influence, to provide a more comprehensive Web3 influence profile.

## **Conclusion**

Integrating EFP with DIP as a decentralized influence credential provides Web3 with a composable, verifiable influence measurement system. It offers new trust mechanisms for social, DAO, DeFi, and NFT ecosystems, fostering the growth of the Web3 influence economy and establishing a universal influence standard within the EIP framework.
